system bootstrapping procedures
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Sy Power fail and crash recovery
Normally, the system will reboot itself at power-up or after crashes.
An automatic consistency check of the file systems will be performed,
and unless this fails, the system will resume multi-user operations.
.Pp
.Sy Cold starts
On an Artesyn PMPPC card, the boot procedure uses the boot monitor to load
a kernel over the network using BOOTP and TFTP.
The file systems are mounted via NFS, as described in
.Xr diskless 8 .
.Pp
.Sy Boot monitor settings
There are a few of settings in the boot monitor that must
be adjusted to boot a kernel.
The settings are modified with the
.Ic nvdisplay
command, followed by a
.Ic nvupdate
to save the new settings.
.Pp
The monitor settings should point to a TFTP server which has the binary
kernel image,
.Pa netbsd.bin ,
which is built when a kernel is compiled.
Furthermore, the monitor should be set up to not initialize PCI devices.
