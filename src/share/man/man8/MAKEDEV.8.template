.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to create system and device special files.
As arguments it takes the names of known devices, like
.Ar sd0 ,
or of special targets, like
.Pa all
or
.Pa std ,
which create a collection of device special files.
.Pp
The script is in
.Pa /dev/MAKEDEV
and must be called from the
.Pa /dev
directory.
For the creation of the devices,
.Xr mknod 8
is used, which can only be used for creating devices by the
super-user.
The
.Xr mknod 8
used can be overridden by the
.Fl m
flag.
.Pp
Supported options are:
.Bl -tag -width XmXmknodXX
.It Fl f
Force permissions to be updated on existing devices.
.It Fl m Ar mknod
Name of

.Sh NOTES
This man page is generated automatically from the same sources
as
.Pa /dev/MAKEDEV ,
in which the device files are not always sorted, which may result
in an unusual (non-alphabetical) order. Not all devices listed
in this manpage are supported on all platforms.
