.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility routines are provided to support caching of constructed objects,
similar to the Solaris SLAB allocator.
.Nm
uses
.Xr pool 9
to allocate memory areas used for objects.
If the pool must be protected from interrupts,
.Nm
routines expect to be called at the appropriate interrupt priority level.

.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn pool_cache_init "pc" "pp" "ctor" "dtor" "arg"
Initialize a pool cache
.Fa pc .
The pool
.Fa pp
should be initialized by the caller in advance.
.Fa ctor
and
.Fa dtor
are object constructor and destructor.
They can be
.Dv NULL .
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn pool_cache_destroy "pc"
Destroy a pool cache
.Fa pc .
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn pool_cache_get_paddr "pc" "flags" "pap"
Get an object from a pool cache
.Fa pc .
If
.Fa pap
is not
.Dv NULL ,
physical address of the object or
.Dv POOL_PADDR_INVALID
will be returned via it.
.Fa flags
will be passed to
.Fn pool_get
function of the backing
.Xr pool 9
and the object constructor specified when the pool cache is created by
.Fn pool_cache_init .
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn pool_cache_get "pc" "flags"
.Fn pool_cache_get
is the same as
.Fn pool_cache_get_paddr
with
.Dv NULL
.Fa pap
argument.
It's implemented as a macro.
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn pool_cache_put_paddr "pc" "object" "pa"
Put an object
.Fa object
back to the pool cache
.Fa pc .
.Fa pa
should be physical address of the object
.Fa object
or
.Dv POOL_PADDR_INVALID .
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn pool_cache_put "pc" "object"
.Fn pool_cache_put
is the same as
.Fn pool_cache_put_paddr
with
.Dv POOL_PADDR_INVALID
.Fa pa
argument.
It's implemented as a macro.
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn pool_cache_destruct_object "pc" "object"
Force destruction of an object
.Fa object
and its release back into the pool.
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn pool_cache_invalidate "pc"
Invalidate a pool cache
.Fa pc .
Destruct and release all of the cached objects.
