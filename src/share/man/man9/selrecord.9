.Dt SELRECORD 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm selrecord ,
.Nm selwakeup
.Nd record and wakeup select requests
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/select.h
.Ft void
.Fn selrecord "struct proc *selector" "struct selinfo *sip"
.Ft void
.Fn selwakeup "struct selinfo *sip"
.Ft void
.Fn selnotify "struct selinfo *sip" "long knhint"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn selrecord
and
.Fn selwakeup
are the two central functions used by
.Xr select 2 ,
.Xr poll 2 ,
and the objects that are being selected on.
They handle the task of recording which threads are waiting on which objects
and the waking of the proper threads when an event of interest occurs on an
object.
.Pp
.Fn selrecord
records that the calling thread is interested in events related to a given
object.
If another thread is already waiting on the object a collision will be flagged
in
.Fa sip
which will be later dealt with by
.Fn selwakeup .
.Pp
.Fn selwakeup
is called by the underlying object handling code in order to notify any waiting
threads that an event of interest has occurred.
If a collision has occurred,
.Fn selwakeup
will increment
.Va nselcoll ,
and wakeup all threads waiting on the global variable
.Va selwait
so that they can handle it.
If the thread waiting on the object is not currently sleeping or the wait
channel is not
.Va selwait ,
.Fn selwakeup
will clear the
.Dv L_SELECT
flag which should be noted by
.Xr select 2
and
.Xr poll 2
when they wake up.
.Pp
.Fn selwakeup
may acquire and release
.Va sched_lock .
.Pp
.Fn selnotify
calls
.Fn selwakup
and then calls
.Fn KNOTE
with
.Va knhint .
In most cases,
.Fn selnotify
should be used rather than using
.Fn selwakeup
directly.
