.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm cpu_coredump
.Nd machine-dependent process core dump interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/signalvar.h
.Ft int
.Fn cpu_coredump "struct proc *p" "struct vnode *vp" "struct ucred *cred" \
"struct core *chdr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn cpu_coredump
is the machine-dependent interface invoked by machine-independent code
to dump the machine-dependent header information at the start of a
process core dump.
The header information primarily consists of the
CPU and floating-point registers.
.Fa p
is the process structure of the processing being dumped.
.Fa vp
is the vnode pointer to the process core dump file.
.Fa cred
are the credentials of the core dump file.
Information about the machine-dependent header sections are returned in
.Fa chdr .
.Pp
.Fn cpu_coredump
returns 0 on success and an appropriate error code on failure.
.Sh CODE REFERENCES
This section describes places within the
.Nx
source tree where actual code implementing or using the
machine-dependent coredump interface can be found.
All pathnames are relative to
.Pa /usr/src .
.Pp
Process core dumps are initiated within the file
.Pa sys/kern/kern_sig.c .
Process core dumps for native
.Nx
binaries are performed within the file
.Pa sys/kern/core_netbsd.c .
