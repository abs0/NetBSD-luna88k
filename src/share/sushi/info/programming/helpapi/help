The help API of sushi simply consists of a file of formatted text that will
be presented to the user in a help box (much like the one you are reading now).
The helpfile may be the only file in the directory, such as a tutotial, or
if there are other items in the directory, it is accessed by the F1 key when
the user requests help in a menu or form.

It is suggested that the file be formatted for an 80 column screen.
