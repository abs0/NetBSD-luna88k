Sushi will scan a number of directories looking for menus and submenus, if
they exist.  The default directories that are currently searched for sushi
menus are listed below:

/usr/share/sushi/
/usr/pkg/share/sushi/
/usr/X11R6/share/sushi/
/etc/sushi/
$HOME/sushi/

/usr/share/sushi is where system supplied menus will appear, such as those
that ship with the NetBSD operating system.

/usr/pkg/share/sushi and /usr/X11R6/share/sushi are designed for use with the
package system, and menus can be installed there as part of packages that wish
to use them.

/etc/sushi is meant to be a user-configurable directory, where users can place
menu items that will be seen system wide.  This is the preferred place to
put menus local to the machine, or that you have written yourself.

The menus are scanned in the above order, and will appear on the menu in
that order.  No differentiation will be made for menus found in the
various directories.  All menu directories will be combined into a single
unified tree for the user.  If a directory does not exist, it is not an
error, and will be ignored.

The searchpath for sushi can be modified, by adding directories, one
directory per line, to the file /etc/sushi.conf.  This file overrides the
built in defaults, which are used if it does not exist.  Each searchpath 
must be preceded by the keyword 'searchpath'.
