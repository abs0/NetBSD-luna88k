This is where you can find help on various parts of making your own menus
and forms within Sushi.  The application has been designed to make it very
simple to make extensible and complex menus and functions.  It is advised
that if you wish to program your own menus, you read the documentation in
the submenus, and look at some of the pre-existing menus.
