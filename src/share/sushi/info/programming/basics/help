The menus and forms in Sushi are very simple to create.  At a minimum,
they consist of a sub directory, an index file, and an action-file of some
sort.

To create a new menu item, you would create a directory, edit the "index"
file in the parent directory, and populate your new directory with the
appropriate files.

The files are searched and executed in a specific order:

index		A file containing definitions for submenus under this one.
preform		A form called before the regular form, to preload it
		with certain values.
form		The actual form definition, which presents the questionaire
		to the user.
script		An executable of some sort.
exec		A file containing the name of a program to run, with
		arguments.
func		Calls a function internal to Sushi.
help		Displays a helpfile, similar to this one.

It is an error to have an "endpoint" (a directory with no additional submenus)
that contains no files, and upon encountering an empty enpoint, Sushi will
exit with an error.
