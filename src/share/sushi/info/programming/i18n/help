Sushi has support for multiple languages built in.  Some of this support
is via the cat* functions in libc, and other portions are via the various
endpoint and action files.

A simple example using the german language is shown:

The user has a subdirectory, with a few endpoints in it, such as a form, a
script, and a helpfile.  Normally, these would be named "form" "script"
and "help".  if the user also wanted to support the german language, the
files could be translated, and named: "form.de", "script.de" and
"help.de".

It is important that when creating index files in an alternate language,
that the names of the subdirectories not be translated, or the
subdirectory will not be found.

In order to fully support an alternate language, the catalog files for
that language must be built, and installed in the /usr/share/nls/<LANG>
directory.

If the user has his language id set to a specific language, and the
appropriate language file (such as help.de) does not exist, the standard
english file will be loaded.
