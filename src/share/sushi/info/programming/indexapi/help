The index programming interface to Sushi consists of a flat ascii file, with
three fields.  The fields are whitespace separated.

The first field, is the name of a subdirectory, which must exist.  No spaces
can exist in this name.

The second field, is the quickpath.  This is a unique keyword that can be used
to automatically access this point within Sushi, when called on the command
line as an argument to sushi.

The final field is the description.  The description must be contained on one
line, and can have embedded whitespace.  The description is limited to about
70 characters, due to screen width.

The special keyword "BLANK" can be used to insert a blank line in the menu.

A simple index file is shown below:

test	test	This is a test menu
BLANK	BLANK	BLANK
more	more	Another test menu item
