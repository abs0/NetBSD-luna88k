Welcome to NetBSD sushi.  This tool is designed to assist you in the
everyday tasks of maintaining and administering your machine.

To use this tool, simply select the menu item that you wish to enter, with
the arrow keys, and hit enter to select it.

You may use any of the function keys listed at the bottom of your screen
to call certain functions within sushi:

F1:   Call up help, if it exists, for the current menu or form.
F2:   Refresh the screen.
F3:   Cancel the current menu, and return to the previous one, or exit sushi.
F8:   Take a screen capture of the current screen and save it to "sushi.image".
F9:   Launch a shell to perform manual tasks.
F10:  Exit sushi immediately.
ESC:  Same as F3, Cancel.
ENTER: Do.

Once you have selected a function to perform, sushi will do one of two
things, it will either run the selected task immediately, or, in the case
of a task which requires user input, present a form to the user.  The user
is expected to fill in the form, and hit enter.  Required fields are
marked with a "*" at the beginning of the line.  Any other fields can be
left unfilled, but should be examined to see if the defaults supplied are
satisfactory. Once this is done, the user-supplied values will be passed
to the controlling scripts, and the task will be attempted.

The output of the task will be displayed to the user in a scrolling
window. Once complete, success or failure will be noted in the status bar
at the top of the screen, and the user can scroll through the output, or
simply hit ESC/ENTER to continue.  If the task was unsuccessful, the user
will be returned to the form, to attempt again if he/she should wish,
otherwise the user is returned to the previous menu.
