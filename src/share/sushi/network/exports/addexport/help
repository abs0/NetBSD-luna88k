Under NetBSD, you may only export a complete filesystem, you cannot
export a subdirectory of a filesystem.  Therefore only filesystem mount
points will be displayed to you.

If you choose to export all subdirectories, clients may mount any
subdirectory of the mount point, rather than the entire mount point.

Mapping root access to a specific user or group means that root on the
client machine, will have the access permissions of the user/group selected.

Allowing unreserved port connections may sometimes be needed for less secure
client implementations.  Using this option will decrease the security of your
system.

Setting the network and netmask allows you to export a filesystem to an
entire network, or subnet.

Hosts/netgroups to export mount to, allows you to specify individual hosts,
or netgroups as may be defined in an /etc/netgroup file, that are allowed to
mount filesystems from this host.  You may specify IP's, hostnames, or
netgroups.  Multiple hosts to export to should be space separated.

For more information and details on exporting filesystems, please see the
exports(5) manpage.
