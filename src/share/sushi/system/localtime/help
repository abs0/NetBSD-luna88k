This form allows you to set the local timezone for this machine. 
Processes that do not override the timezone in thier environments, and
users logging in (who also do not override thier timezone) will use this
as the system timezone. 

You may choose to link or copy the file.  Linking provides you with an
easy way to determine your current timezone (simply ls -l /etc/localtime),
while copying the file, allows the timezone to be correct if /usr should
fail to mount.
