Using the various forms and functions in this menu, you can start and stop
daemons on your machine.  The configured daemons are those that you have
set up to run at boot time in your /etc/rc.conf file. 
Starting/stopping/restarting an unconfigured daemon will not change it's
configuration for the next reboot.  If you wish for it to start
automatically at your next boot, you should edit it from the
system/rc.conf menu. 

The top 15 process functions are a quick and dirty way for you to observe
which processes on your machine are taking up the most resources.  For a
much better and more interactive way to do this, see the top(1) program
and manpage.
