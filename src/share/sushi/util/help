This submenu provides access to utilities within sushi.  Most of these
affect the run time behavior of sushi.

Scripting will turn on or off the scripting functionality of sushi.  When on,
sushi will record all commands executed in a file called "sushi.script"
placed in the current working directory where you executed sushi.  This
file can be executed as a shell script to completely replay the entire
session.  This can be useful when configuring multiple identical machines.

Logging will turn on or off the logging functionality of sushi.  When on,
sushi will record a log of all commands executed in a file called "sushi.log"
placed in the current working directory where you executed sushi.

The current status of logging or scripting can be seen at the bottom of your
screen in the help bar.  Changes made here to logging or scripting are only
effective for the current execution of sushi.
