BUGS/PROBLEMS:

* Reports "ldd: mmap of entire address space failed: Cannot allocate memory",
  or erroneously reports that libraries cannot be found,
  when run on many files (`ldd /usr/bin/*').


TO DO:

* Support for executable formats other than ELF.

* Support for coexistance of 32-bit and 64-bit ELF.
