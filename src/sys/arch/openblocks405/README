This port support OpenBlockS type S and R those are using IBM's
PPC405GP that is sold from PlatHome.  Since old OpenBlockS is using
MPC860 instead of 405GP, thus the port is separated.  Although
userland binary may be compatible.

Since this hardware is very similar to walnut(maybe a lots of IBM405
based products are similar), I will have taken from or will be linking
to a lots of code of walnut.
