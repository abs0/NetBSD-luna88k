- Make KTH Kerberos IV API like the Berkeley'ized MIT API that
  appeared in 4.4BSD.  This also means include paths and library
  requirements.

- Make the Heimdal Kerberos V API much more like the MIT API.  The
  current situation means that basically no krb5-aware programs can
  work with Heimdal without significant modification.  This includes
  making compatibility links for e.g. libk5crypto -> libcrypto, etc.

  Currently known-broken Kerberos-aware packages:
  - ssh and ssh6

- Make rcp, rlogin, ftpd, and ftp work with Kerberos again.

- Decide if we're going to really try and support both krb4 and
  krb5.  It's hard to make programs work with both, and having
  to decide at compile-time really sucks.

- Add Heimdal's ticket forwarding support to the Berkeley Kerberos 4
  module (in libtelnet).
