 * XXX TKM - added the following comments - someone please verify.
 *
 * The system call code is passed in r13.
 *
 * The first 8 argument words are in registers r2-r9; the rest
 * are on the stack.  The first 3 stack-based argument words are
 * moved into r10-r12 for syscalls.  Syscalls with > 11 argument
 * words are not needed/allowed/supported on m88k.
 *
 * NetBSD/88k uses the SysV ABI, which reserves stack space for
 * the first 8 arguments even though they are passed in registers.
 * Note that OpenBSD does not reserve this stack space.
