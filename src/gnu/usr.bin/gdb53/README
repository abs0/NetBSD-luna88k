This note describes how to add support for gdb53 to a platform.

To make gdb work on your platform of choice you need to populate the files in
    /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/gdb53/arch/<platform>

1. Build gdb using the standard configure mechanism in the distribution
   directory /usr/src/gnu/dist/gdb.

   Alternatively, configure and build in a scratch directory, so that
   you can avoid doing the last distclean step of this instructions.

2. Copy generated files (the ?m.h are not present on some platforms)
        cp gdb/{tm.h,nm.h,xm.h,config.h} ...arch/<platform>
        cp gdb/init.c ...arch/<platform>/gdb-init.c
        cp arch/i386/version.c arch/<platform>
        cp arch/i386/defs.mk arch/<platform>

3. Add coredump and netbsd thread support to init.c (we should fix the autoconf
   stuff to do this automatically). At the declaration section on init.c add:

extern initialize_file_ftype _initialize_nbsd_thread;
#ifdef USE_TUI
extern initialize_file_ftype _initialize_tui;
extern initialize_file_ftype _initialize_tuiLayout;
extern initialize_file_ftype _initialize_tuiRegs;
extern initialize_file_ftype _initialize_tuiStack;
extern initialize_file_ftype _initialize_tuiWin;
extern initialize_file_ftype _initialize_tui_out;
#endif
extern initialize_file_ftype _initialize_corelow;

and at the bottom add:

  _initialize_nbsd_thread ();
#ifdef USE_TUI
  _initialize_tui ();
  _initialize_tuiLayout ();
  _initialize_tuiRegs ();
  _initialize_tuiStack ();
  _initialize_tuiWin ();
  _initialize_tui_out ();
#endif
  _initialize_corelow ();

4. Fix defs.mk to have the right files. The readline, libiberty,
   ones should be ok; for the others, go to the build directory

   ls -1 *.o | sed -e 's/$/ \\/' 

   and then incorporate the resulting sections into defs.mk. This should be
   done for bfd, gdb, opcodes.

5. Fix defs.mk to have the right bfd flags in G_BFD_CPPFLAGS.  Copy
   them from `tdefaults' variable in generated bfd/Makefile.

6. Make distclean in the distribution directory and cvs update [distclean
   removes some generated files we committed because they don't change across
   platforms]
