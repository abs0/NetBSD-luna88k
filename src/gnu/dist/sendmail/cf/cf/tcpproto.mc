#  This is the prototype file for a configuration that supports nothing
#  but basic SMTP connections via TCP.
#
#  You MUST change the `OSTYPE' macro to specify the operating system
#  on which this will run; this will set the location of various
#  support files for your operating system environment.  You MAY
#  create a domain file in ../domain and reference it by adding a
#  `DOMAIN' macro after the `OSTYPE' macro.  I recommend that you
#  first copy this to another file name so that new sendmail releases
#  will not trash your changes.
