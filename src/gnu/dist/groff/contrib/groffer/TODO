TODO file for `groffer'

File position: <groff-source>/contrib/groffer/TODO


####### TODO

Optimization:
- Optimize man path determination in manpath_add_lang_sys() for speed
  by building-up the man path only by and by as far as necessary
  (not trivial).
- To increase the running speed write part of the groffer shell script
  in C/C++.
- Split the groffer.sh shell script into several files for better tests
  of the shell compatibility.

Features:
- Revise option handling of `grog'.
- `gxditview' needs a complete shower.

Revision:
- Revise the `--all' feature to better reflect GNU man.
- The debug function stack is buggy (no effect on normal operation).

Documentation:
- Improve the documentation of the search algorithm for man pages in
  both the groffer script and the man page `groffer.man'.
- In `groff.man', add more documentation for parts that were taken over
  from GNU `man'.
- The documentation in the headers for some function definitions in
  `groffer.sh' needs to be updated.
