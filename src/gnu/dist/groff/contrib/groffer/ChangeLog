	________________________________________________________________
	* release of groffer 0.9.5

	This version is a rewrite of groffer in many parts, but it is kept
	in the old single script style.

	Overview of new options:
	--text, --mode text, --tty-viewer,
	--X, --mode X, --X-viewer, --html, --mode html, --html-view,
	--apropos-data, --apropos-devel, --apropos-progs

	New file:
	<groffer-source>/README_SH

	
	******* Extension of the `apropos' handling

        The output of man's `apropos' has grown immensely meanwhile, so it
	has become inefficient.  Now `groffer' provides new options to get
	the a selected information from this output.

	* groffer.sh:
        `--apropos-progs': new option for displaying only information
        on programs (man page sections 1, 6, and 8)
        `--apropos-data': new option for displaying only information
        on documented data (man page sections 4, 5 and 7)
        `--apropos-devel': new option for displaying only information
        on development documentation (man page sections 2, 3 and 9)
        `--apropos': still displays just the output of man's `apropos'
	program.
	- Specify all of these options as a single argument option; that
	makes groffer's `--apropos' option slightly different because
	the corresponding `man' option does not have arguments,	but takes
	all file arguments as apropos targets.  So just ignore the `man'
	options `-k' and `--apropos' in the parsing of $MANOPT.
	- Exit after processing one `apropos' call.


	******* Quasi object oriented function arguments

	An object is the name of an environment variable.  The value of
	this variable contains the object's content.  This allows to
	specify function arguments and the calling syntax in a simpler way
	by letting the first argument be a variable name, usable for input
	or output.
	
	Such an object type is `list', the string value of a shell
	variable arranged in space-separated single-quoted elements, such
	as $GROFFER_OPT internally.

	* groffer.sh:
	- Remove list_from_args(), list_element_from_arg()
	list_from_lists(), list_length(), and list_prepend().
	They can be replaced by list_append().
	- All list*() functions are rearranged such that the first
	argument is a list object, the name of a variable.


	******* Simplification of configuration files

	The new syntax of the groffer configuration files is
	- all lines starting with a `-' character are interpreted as
	command line options for all calls of groffer; they are collected
	and prepended to the actual value of $GROFFER_OPT; optional
	spaces at the beginning.of the line are omitted.
	- all other lines are interpreted as a shell command and executed
	in the current shell of the groffer call.
	
	Precedence:
	- The command line and the external environment variables such as
	$GROFFER_OPT of the groffer call have the highest precedence.
	- This is overwritten by the configuration file in the user's home
	directory.
	- The system configuration file in /etc has the lowest
	precedence.
	
	* groffer.sh:	
	The configuration files are now called after the determination of
	the temporary files in main_init().


	******* Script file name

	The file name of the script is needed for the several calls during
	the search for the optimal shell.

	* groffer.sh:
	- $_GROFFER_SH: replace $_this by $_GROFFER_SH and use $0 for
	determining the file name of the script for the following calls,
	instead of the cumbersome @BINDIR@ construction.
	- Force the script to be called as an executable file, so $0 must
	contain the program name.

	
	******* Improved temporary file names

	Just like groff, groffer mixes all file parameters into a single
	output file.  Its name is now constructed as a comma-separated
	list built from the file name arguments without a leading comma.
	So a leading comma can be used for the internal temporary file
	names.
	
	* groffer.sh:
	- $_OUTPUT_FILE_NAME: new global variable as basis for the output
	file name; it is set in main_set_resources().
        - tmp_create(): use `,name' for temporary files different from
	output file because the output file name does not start with a
	comma.  `$$' is not needed anymore.
	- main_display(): simplification of $_modefile in _do_display()
	and single display modes.
	- Add extension `.html' to output file name in html mode.
	- base_name(): correction for strange positions of `/'.


	******* Mode fixes

	* groffer.sh:
	- Set the main default mode to `x' with groff's	X Window viewer
	`gxditview'.
	- Allow 'x' and 'X' in `--mode' for the X Window mode; the same
	for `--x' and `X', `--x-viewer' and `--X-viewer'.
	- Make groff's `-X' equivalent to `mode X'.
	- Fix `--auto', `--mode auto',  and `--default-modes'.
	- `html' mode: new mode equivalent to `www', add `konqueror' and
	`lynx' as viewers.
	- `pdf' mode: fix zoom options for pdf-viewer `xpdf' in
	main_set_resources(); in main_display() fix the display structure.
	- Set default X Window resolution to 75dpi.  This is not optimal,
	but with a higher value the options and resources for some viewers
	must be optimized.
	`--text' and `--mode text': new option for text output without a
	pager.
	- `--tty-viewer': new option equivalent to `--pager'.
	- Correct the pagers for `tty' mode.
	- Fix `groff' mode in main_set_resources() and main_display().
	- Harmonize `--mode arg' with the equivalent options `--arg'.


	******* Fixes for command line options

	* groffer.sh:
	- list_from_cmdline(): fix the parsing of options with arguments.
	- Rename $_OPT_TTY_DEVICE to $_OPT_TEXT_DEVICE.
	- $_OPTS_X_*: new variables for the inhereted X Window variables.
	- Improve the distribution of the command line options into
	$_OPTS_GROFFER_*, $_OPTS_GROFF_*, $_OPTS_X_*, and $_OPTS_MAN_*.
	- $_OPTS_MANOPT_*: new variables for the parsing of $MANOPT.
	- Correct $_OPTS_CMDLINE_*.
	- Remove some unused $_OPTS_*.
	- `--iconic': new option from `-iconic' of the X Window toolkit.
	- Correct `--rv' to an option without argument.
	- Minor fixes of other  X Window toolkit options.


	******* Other fixes

	* groffer.sh:
	- is_prog(): allow 0 arguments.
	- is_not_writable(): new function.
	- is_*(): fix trailing return codes.
        - Replace most `test' calls by is_*() functions.
	- man_setup(): due to bugs in `manpath', prefer
	manpath_set_from_path() for the determination of the man page path.
	- man_search_section(): correction of some `for' loops.
	- Remove export of external non-groffer variables.

	
	******* Documentation
	
	* groffer.man:
	- Reorder the option details according to the option origin as
	groffer, groff, X, and man options.
	- Add the programming changes information mentioned above.
	- Support man pages with a dot in their name

	* README_SH: new file
	Move large parts of the documentation in `groffer.sh' into this
	file.
	
	* groffer.sh: usage():
	- Change the output for `--help' to standard output.
	- Restructure the information for this help output.
	

	******* Removement of the author's email address
	
	Because of the extreme spam attacks, the author removed all
	occurencies of his email address in every file of the groffer
	source.

2003-01-22  Bernd Warken 
	________________________________________________________________
	* release of groffer 0.9.4

	* groffer.sh: corrections for some restrictive shells
	- Possible exit codes in actual `ash' are between 0 and 63.  To
	handle even deeper restrictions, use 7 as maximal code instead
	of 255 as replacement for error -1.
	- Remove variables $_BAD2 and $_BAD3.
	- Replace `trap' argument `EXIT' by 0 and write new fuctions
	`trap_clean' and `trap_set' to handle the restrictions of `trap'
	for some shells.
	- Correct wrong $MANPATH to $_MAN_PATH in function
	`man_do_filespec'.
	- Test existence of directory before deleting it in the
	`clean_up' definitions.
	- Correct help output in `usage' (called by `--help').
	
	* TODO:
	Remove mention of `shoop' and `apropos'.

2002-10-21  Bernd Warken 
	________________________________________________________________
	* release of groffer 0.9.3

	* groffer.sh: new temporary subdirectory
	- Generate temporary subdirectory for storing temporary files
	with better names in future groffer versions (name:
	"groffer$$" in usual temporary directory).
	- Use `umask 000' for temporary files to allow cleaning up
	for everyone after a system break.
	- Change both clean_up() functions (for normal shell and
	for main_display() subshell) to handle the new subdirectory.
	- clean_up_secondary() and $_TMP_PREFIX are unnecessary now, so
	they were removed.

	* Makefile.sub: `sed' commands for "groffer:"
	- Remove "@g@" entry (not used in "groffer.sh").
	- Add global replace for "@BINDIR@" and "@VERSION@" for future
	usage.

	* TODO: think about...
	- writing part of groffer in C/C++.
	- handling several files with different macro packages.
	
2002-10-17  Bernd Warken 
	________________________________________________________________
	* fixes of groffer 0.9.2

	* groffer.sh:
	Terminate main_parse_MANOPT() if $MANOPT is empty or consists
	of space characters only.

	* groffer.man: some fixes in "GROFFER OPTIONS"
	- New macro ".Header_CB" for CB font in .TP headers; used for
	definition of variables in option --mode.
	- Fix some option references to refer to long options.
	
	* README:
	New file for general information on the groffer source; it is
	not installed.

	* Makefile.sub:
	add replacement "@BINDIR@" to "$(bindir)" for "groffer:"

	* groffer.sh:
	Define $_this as "@BINDIR@/${_PROGRAM_NAME}" to save the right
	installation position of groffer for the special shell calling.

2002-10-13  Bernd Warken 
	________________________________________________________________
	* release of groffer 0.9.2

	* groffer.sh: fixes
	- Fix some 'sed' functions: two in func_stack_dump(), one in
	  base_name(), add 'sed' command in list_from_cmdline().
	- Finish main_parse_MANOPT() if $MANOPT is empty.
	- Sort $_OPTS_GROFF_SHORT_NA like groff short options (but
	  unchanged).
	- Fix some comments.

	* groffer.man: make it more readable (but no additions)

2002-09-30  Bernd Warken 
	________________________________________________________________
	* release of groffer 0.9.1
	
	* TODO: remove done entries
	- Remove request for different shells.
	- Remove the 'sed' complaints.

2002-07-15  Bernd Warken 

	* groffer.sh: replace `sed' interface by direct `sed'
	- This improves the performance of the shell programming parts
	  and shortens the groffer script by about 5%.
	- Remove functions: string_del_append(), string_del_leading(),
	  string_del_trailing(), string_flatten(), string_get_before(),
	  string_get_leading(), string_replace_all(), string_sed_s(),
	  and their auxiliary functions.
	- Replace all calls of these functions by direct `sed' commands.
	- Define variables for special characters to ease `sed' calls.
	- Remove `$APPEND'.
	- Restrict list_from_string() to single character separators.
	- Correct list_check() and base_name().
	- Add comments to all calls of `sed'.

	* groffer.sh: add run-time support for several shells
	- New option `--shell': stop execution and rerun groffer under
	  the shell specified in the argument of `--shell'.
	- If no shell was specified at run-time, `ash' is tried first;
	  if `ash' is not available continue with the shell with which
	  groffer was called from the command line, or with the shell
	  name in the first line of the script, actually `/bin/sh'.

2002-07-12  Bernd Warken 
	________________________________________________________________
	* fixes for groffer 0.9.0

	* groffer.sh: enhance version information
	`groffer -v|--version' now print:
	- groffer's version number and date
	- the string `is part of '
	- groff's version information (version number and copyright),
	  but not groff's `called subprograms' information.
	
	* groffer.sh: minor fixes
	- Fix the argument parser to process argument `-' correctly.
	- Some display programs have trouble with empty input; feed a
	  line consisting of a single space character in this case for
	  all display modes (not for source or groff modes).

	* TODO:
	fix entry `shoop' (not 'shopt').

2002-06-28  Bernd Warken 
	________________________________________________________________
	* release of groffer 0.9.0

	* groffer.sh: new mode `pdf'
	- PDF (Portable Document Format):
	  -> Transform groff `ps' output into pdf using `gs'.
	  -> Pro: PDF viewers provide text searching (!).
	  -> Con: the transformation is quite slow.
	  -> Not suitable as an auto mode.
	- New options `--pdf', `--pdf-viewer', `--mode pdf'.
	- Standard pdf viewers `xpdf' and `acroread'.
	- For `xpdf', choose zoom `z 3' for 100 dpi, `z 2' for 75 dpi.
	
	* groffer.sh: support bzip2 decompression
	- add test for `bzip2' with necessary options
	- extend functions `catz()' and `save_stdin()'.

	* TODO
	remove entry on `bzip' decompression (done).
	
	* groffer.man:
	- Document new `pdf' features.
	- Document new `bzip2' decompression.
	- Fix documentation for `--auto-modes'.
	
	* groffer.sh: minor fixes
	- Improve device tests in `tty' and `dvi' modes.
	- Internally, map mode `auto' to '' to facilitate tests.
	- Fix auto mode sequence to: `ps,x,tty' as was intended.

2002-06-25  Bernd Warken 

	* groffer.sh:
	Fix `source' mode.

	* groffer.man:
	Fix some indentations.

2002-06-23  Bernd Warken 
	________________________________________________________________
	* release of groffer 0.8

	* Makefile.sub: add copyright section

	* groffer.man:
	- Document the new options.
	- Revise the documentation of the modes.
	- Document the configuration files in new section `FILES'.
	- Redesign section `EXAMPLES'.
	- Remove documentation for `-W'.
	
	* groffer.sh: new debugging features
	- Disabled by default; enabled by environment variables.
	- Add landmark() to catch typos with quotes.
	- Add a function call stack for suitable functions; implemented
	  as within the argument checker func_check().
	- This implies the need to provide `return' with some clean-up
	  facility; implemented as `eval "$_return_..."'.
	- Add option `--debug' to enable debugging at run-time.
	- Actually, the groffer script uses only shell builtins found
	  in `ash' (a subset of POSIX) and POSIX `sed' as the only
	  external shell utility.
		
	* groffer.sh: customization of viewers
	- In `groff' mode, the groffer viewing facilities are disabled.
	- The postprocessor option `-P' costumizes the viewer only in
	  some situations in the `groff' mode, so a new infrastructure
	  for viewer customization is necessary.
	- Allow to specify arguments to the viewer programs specified
	  in `--*-viewer()'.
	- Implement some of the essential X Toolkit resource options in
	  groffer, but with use a leading double minus.
	  -> `--bd': set border color.
	  -> `--bg', `--background': set background color.
	  -> `--bw': set border width.
	  -> `--display': set X display.
	  -> `--geometry': set size and position of viewer window.
	  -> `--fg', `--foreground': set foreground color.
	  -> `--ft', `--font': set font.
	  -> `--resolution': set X resolution in dpi.
	  -> `--title': set viewer window title.
	  -> `--xrm': set X resource.
	- Remove misnamed option `--xrdb'.
	
	* groffer.sh: new mode structure
	- New Postcript mode `ps' (`--ps'):
	  -> default viewers: gv,ghostview,gs_x11,gs;
	  -> `--ps-viewer' sets the Postscript viewer.
	- New mode `www' (`--www') for displaying in a web browser:
	  -> default browsers: mozilla,netscape,opera,amaya,arena;
	  -> `--www-viewer' sets the web browser.
	- New dvi mode (`--dvi'); default viewer `xdvi':
	  -> default viewers: xdvi,dvilx;
	  -> `--dvi-viewer' sets the dvi viewer.
	- New mode `auto':
	  -> active if no other mode is given or by new option `--auto';
	  -> selects from a sequence of modes that are tested until one
	    of them succeeds.
	  -> the default mode sequence is actually `ps', `x', `tty'.
	  -> `--default-modes' sets this mode sequence as a comma
	     separated string of program names, optionally each one
	     with arguments).
	- New mode `groff':
	  -> process input like groff, ignore viewing options.
	  -> activated by new option `--groff'.
	  -> automatically active with one of `-V', `-X', `-Z'.
	- Revise `tty' mode:
	  -> allow several text devices.
	  -> 
	- Reorganize the mode management:
	  -> new mode setting option `--mode'.
	  -> logically separate source, groff, and display modes.
	  -> intermediate output mode is now part of mode groff; remove
	     any special features around `-Z'.
	- Update usage() to reflect the new option structure.

	* groffer.sh: add configuration files
	- `/etc/groff/groffer.conf' system-wide configuration.
	- `${HOME}/.groff/groffer.conf' user configuration.
	- The configuration file are shell scripts for now; later
	  implementations can identify this from the `#! /bin/sh' line.
	
	* groffer.sh: new data structure `list':
	- Implement a `list' data structure as a string consisting of
	  single-quoted elements, separated by a space character;
	  embedded single-quotes are escaped.

	* groffer.sh: new option parser based on `list':
	- Write new option parser based on `list', compatible to both
	  POSIX getopts() and GNU getopt().
	- Long options are now available on GNU and non-GNU systems.
	- Get rid of POSIX getopts() and GNU getopt().
	- the `-W--longopt' construct is now obsolete; remove it.
	- add test/function for `unset'.
	- Option strings are now implemented as `list's in order to
	  allow unusual characters in options.
	- Parse $MANOPT first; translate essential arguments into
	  groffer options.
	
	* groffer.man:
	- determine prompt length for `.Shell_cmd'* dynamically.
	- naming scheme for static strings and registers changed to
	  `namespace:macro.variable'.

	
2002-06-16  Werner Lemberg  <wl@gnu.org>

	* groffer.sh:
	Implement man option `--ascii' by `-mtty-char'.
           

2002-05-31  Werner LEMBERG  <wl@gnu.org>

        * groffer.man (@.Shell_cmd_width):
	Increase to 4m (we use `sh#' as the prompt).


2002-05-31  Bernd Warken 
	________________________________________________________________
	* release of groffer 0.7

	* groffer.sh: remove incompatibilities with the `ash' shell:
	- do not use `!command':
          -> use `else'
	  -> write `_not_' equivalents for some functions
	- do not use `[^]' in `case':
	  ->  restructure some functions.
	- only single-character names for loop variables:
	  -> spoils the paradigm of leading `_' for local variables.
	- spurious trouble with `for i in ${var}':
	  -> use `eval set -- ${var}' and `for i in "$@"'
	- do not change or use $IFS:
	  -> define new functions string_split() and `path_split()'.
	  -> result must be processed by `eval set --'.
	  -> solve conflicts with existing positional parameters.
	- trouble with exporting external `$GROFF_*' variables:
	  -> hope that they were exported in the calling shell.
	- not smart about additional blanks:
	  -> remove unnecessary white space.

	* groffer.sh: improve run-time speed:
	- `ash' more than doubles the speed of `bash'.
	- speed-up `man_setup()'.


2002-05-30  Werner Lemberg  <wl@gnu.org>

	* groffer.man:
	- remove some wrong `\:'.
	- rename macro names that start with a `[' (clashes with refer).
	- fix TP_header.


2002-05-28  Bernd Warken 
	________________________________________________________________
	* release of groffer 0.6

	This is almost a complete rewrite since groffer 0.5 .
	________________________________________________________________
	* Documentation
	
	* groffer.man:
   	- Apply the changes done in www.tmac (.URL and .MTO)
	- Replace \fP by \f[].
	- Redesign and rewrite most macros.
	- Include the documentation for the new features.
	- Greatly enlarge section ENVIRONMENT
	- Add examples.

	* TODO:
	- Start a TODO file with several sections.

	* ChangeLog:
	Due to the many changes, shorten and rearrange the entries
	since groffer 0.5 .
	________________________________________________________________
	* Shell compatibility

	* groffer.sh:
	- Due to possible conflicts in old BSD versions, `[]' was
	  replaced by `test'; the `test' options `-a' and `-o' were
	  replaced by multiple calls of `test'.
	- Write interface to the `sed' command `s' to become
	  independent of the delimiter character.  Rewrite all text
	  manipulating function to use this new scheme.  The new
	  functions are named `string_*'.
	- `tr' is not needed any longer, replaced by `sed'.
	- `grep' is not needed any longer, mostly replaced by `case'.
	- Revision of test for `getopt'.
	- Remove `set -a'; explicitly export variables.
	- The only external programs used are POSIX `sed' and the
	  fallback to `apropos'.  All other program calls were
	  replaced by shell builtins and functions.
	
	________________________________________________________________
	* Cosmetics

	* groffer.sh:
	- Implement a prefix based naming scheme for local variables
	  and functions (OOP-like).
	- Introduce variables for white space (better readability with
	  $IFS).
	- Store the names of the processed filespecs into a variable
	  instead of a temporary file.
	- Error-prone shell constructions were replaced by functions
	  with a simple interface.
	- To avoid too long pipes, replace supercat() by do_fileargs();
	  every input file is handled independently.

	________________________________________________________________
	* New features:
	- Add support for more X devices (e.g. X75-12 and X100-12).
	- Add long option `--intermediate_output' to `-Z'.
	- Make the options for mode selection clobber each other.
	- Add option `--mode' with an argument having the following
	  values:
	  `X': force displaying in X, same as options `-X';
	  `tty': display with a pager on text terminal; same as `--tty';
	  `source', `default', `auto', etc.
	- Make the handling of the X mode like in groff (e.g. -X -Tps).
	- Make resolution for gxditview behave like groff (default
	  75 dpi).
	- Add environment variable $GROFFER_OPT to preset groffer
	  options.

	________________________________________________________________
	* implement most of the functionality of GNU `man'.

	- Add all `man' long options to groffer.
	- Add all `man' environment variables.
	- Parse and use content of `$MANOPT'.
	- The precedence of the options and environment variables
	  is regulated like in GNU `man'.
	- Force the option `--manpath' to have a colon-separated
	  argument like GNU `man'.
	- Support `man section name' calling convention.
	- Remove all dependencies on `man -w'.

	* groffer.sh:
