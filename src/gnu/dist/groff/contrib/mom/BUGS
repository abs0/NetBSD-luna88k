========================================================================

KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------

The indent macros from the typesetting macro set may not always
perform well in conjunction with the document processing macros,
especially when documents are set in columns.  Mostly, this is the
result of inadequate testing.  There are only so many "who'd want to
do this anyway?" scenarios I can think of on my own.

Epigraphs at the bottoms of page may sometimes run exactly one line
deeper than they should.  The alternative (from my point of view) is
to have them run 1 line shorter than they should.  The problem stems
from the fact the epigraphs are leaded differently than all other text,
and there's only so much adjusting that can be done with the whitespace
surrounding them to get them to bottom align.  Since stylistically,
epigraphs should never appear at the bottom of a page/column without at
least some running text beneath them in order to make sense of the role
they play in page layout, this not likely to be fixed for some time.
