# XXX notyet:
# mailq.1 sendmail.1 newaliases.1
# These would conflict with the ones installed by sendmail. It isn't
# clear what to do with them. The missing documentation is not too
# interesting given that the sendmail docs are in place, though.
# qmqp-sink.1 qmqp-source.1 smtp-sink.1 smtp-source.1 qshape.1
# These are test programs. It isn't clear that they are wanted by an
# ordinary user.
